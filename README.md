# Vactation Rentals Around Denver (VRAD)

A vacation rentals app that shows the user areas and listings around Denver

## Goals and Objectives

- Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components
- Use a modular architecture for your application file structure
- Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods
- Become familiar with promises, nested fetch requests, and handling the UI based on acceptance of data
- Become familiar with routing and how to handle dynamic routes
- Use propTypes for every component receiving props
- Write tests for React components and some asynchronous functionality

## Setup

1. Clone down this repo
2. Install the library dependencies. Run: 
```
npm install
```
3. Then, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:3000/` and you should see the page there! Then, you can enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

## Technologies Used
- React
- create-react-app
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- DOM Testing Library
- the fetch API
- JavaScript

## Future Iterations
- Implement favoriting/unfavoriting a listing functionality (this would include implementing a /favorites route that displays only the favorited cards, error handling if there are no favorites)
- Build out media queries for mobile responsiveness
- Have user and favorites data persist in localStorage
- Interactive map of listings
